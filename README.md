# Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

Hello! My name is Jakub Czarnik, and I warmly welcome you to my GitHub profile. 

## About Me
Since I was young, I’ve been interested in science, especially math. I loved solving tough problems and always learning something new. Plus, I’ve always enjoyed sharing what I know with others. When I first learned about machine learning, I knew right away that this was the field I wanted to work in. It combines my love for math, computer science, the joy of continuous learning, and the satisfaction of solving complex problems that I’ve had since I was a kid.
