# Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

Hello! My name is Jakub Czarnik, and I warmly welcome you to my GitHub profile. I'm a 20-year-old computer vision enthusiast, constantly developing my skills in this field. 

## About Me
I began my journey with Python at the start of 2022, when I had to learn it to pass an important exam in my country that would allow me to get into a good university. Shortly after taking the exam, I became very interested in machine learning. So much so that I decided to teach myself everything about it, as I believe this is the most efficient way to learn.

## Interests

From a young age, I loved learning, especially exact sciences including mathematics. I love mathematics so much that I could confidently call it my passion since childhood. This is one of the reasons why I fell in love with machine learning when I started learning about it. This field literally has all the aspects that excite me: incredibly difficult problems, complex calculations, programming, and at the end, immense satisfaction from solving a problem.

Thank you for visiting my profile!
