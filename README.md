# Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

Hello! My name is Jakub Czarnik, and I warmly welcome you to my GitHub profile. 

## About Me
Since I was young, I’ve been interested in science, especially math. I loved solving tough problems and always learning something new. Plus, I’ve always enjoyed sharing what I know with others. When I first learned about machine learning, I knew right away that this was the field I wanted to work in. It combines my love for math, computer science, the joy of continuous learning, and the satisfaction of solving complex problems that I’ve had since I was a kid.

## Skills
- **Python**:  Proficient with 2 years of self-education experience.
- **Machine learning**:  Skilled in TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Scikit-Learn with 1 year of self-education experience.

## Certifications:
- **Tensorflow Developer Certificate**

## Main Projects

#### Machine Learning:
- **Classical ML Algorithms Implementation** (C++):  Developed implementations of six popular machine learning algorithms (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, K-Means, KNN, Naive Bayes, PCA) using C++.
- **Machine Learning Framework from Scratch** (NumPy):  Built a Dense layer from scratch using NumPy, which was utilized to construct Classifier and GAN models trained on the Cifar-10 dataset.
   
#### Computer Vision:
- **cWGAN-GP** (Tensorflow):  Developed a conditional Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty on the Cifar-10 dataset.
- **Object Detection** (Tensorflow):  Created an Object Detection model to detect and classify 80 classes from the COCO2017 dataset.
- **Multi-Pose Estimation** (Tensorflow):  Currently working on a multi-pose estimation model.
